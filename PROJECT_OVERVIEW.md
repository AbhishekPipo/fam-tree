### **Why Neo4j for Family Trees?**
```
Traditional SQL:                    Neo4j Graph:
┌─────────────┐                    ┌─────────────┐
│   Users     │                    │    John     │
├─────────────┤                    │   (User)    │
│ id: 1       │                    └──────┬──────┘
│ name: John  │                           │ FATHER_OF
│ father_id:2 │                           ▼
└─────────────┘                    ┌─────────────┐
                                   │    Jane     │
Multiple JOINs needed              │   (User)    │
for complex queries                └─────────────┘
                                   
                                   Single traversal for
                                   any relationship depth
```

(John:User)-[:CHILD_OF]->(Grandpa:User)
```

## 📊 Data Model & Relationships

### **Node Types**
- **User**: Individual family members with comprehensive profiles

### **Relationship Types**

The system automatically calculates complex relationships:
- **Grandparent**: `(User)-[:PARENT_OF*2]->(Grandchild)`
- **Uncle/Aunt**: `(User)-[:PARENT_OF]->(Parent)-[:SIBLING_OF]->(Uncle)`
- **Cousin**: `(User)-[:PARENT_OF]->(Parent)-[:SIBLING_OF]->(Uncle)-[:PARENT_OF]->(Cousin)`
- **In-Laws**: Through spouse connections to their family tree
