# Service Layer Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a proper service layer architecture for the Family Tree application. The service layer was added to separate business logic from HTTP request handling, improving code maintainability, testability, and reusability.

## Problem Addressed

**Before**: Controllers were directly accessing models and handling complex business logic, leading to:
- Tight coupling between HTTP layer and data layer
- Difficult to test business logic
- Code duplication across controllers
- Mixed responsibilities (HTTP handling + business logic)

**After**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated service layer handling all business logic.

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Controllers   │───▶│    Services     │───▶│     Models      │
│ (HTTP Handling) │    │ (Business Logic)│    │ (Data Access)   │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

## Implemented Services

### 1. BaseService (`src/services/baseService.js`)
Common functionality shared across all services:
- Input validation helpers
- Error handling utilities
- Pagination helpers
- Data sanitization methods

### 2. ValidationService (`src/services/validationService.js`)
Centralized input validation:
- User registration validation
- Login data validation
- Family member data validation
- Profile update validation
- Email, password, and date validation

### 3. AuthService (`src/services/authService.js`)
User authentication and profile management:
- `register(userData)` - Register new users
- `login(email, password)` - User authentication
- `logout(user)` - User logout
- `getProfile(userId)` - Get user profile
- `updateProfile(user, updateData)` - Update user profile
- `deleteAccount(user)` - Delete user account

### 4. FamilyService (`src/services/familyService.js`)
Family tree and relationship management:
- `getFamilyTree(userId)` - Get complete family tree
- `addFamilyMember(memberData, currentUserId)` - Add family members
- `getAllFamilyMembers(userId)` - Get simplified family list
- `removeFamilyMember(memberId, currentUserId)` - Remove family members
- `getRelationshipStats(userId)` - Get relationship statistics

## Controller Updates

### AuthController (`src/controllers/authController.js`)
**Before**: 50+ lines of business logic per method
**After**: 3-5 lines per method, delegating to services

```javascript
// Before
const register = catchAsync(async (req, res) => {
  // 50+ lines of validation, business logic, database operations
});

// After
const register = catchAsync(async (req, res) => {
  const { user, token } = await authService.register(req.body);
  res.status(201).json({
    success: true,
    message: 'User registered successfully',
    data: { user, token }
  });
});
```

### FamilyController (`src/controllers/familyController.js`)
**Before**: 400+ lines with complex family tree logic
**After**: 84 lines, clean service delegation

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Controllers handle HTTP requests/responses only
- Services handle business logic
- Models handle data access

### 2. **Improved Testability**
- Business logic can be tested independently
- Services can be mocked for controller tests
- Clear interfaces for unit testing

### 3. **Code Reusability**
- Services can be used by multiple controllers
- Business logic is centralized and reusable
- Common functionality in BaseService

### 4. **Better Error Handling**
- Consistent error handling across services
- Centralized validation with clear error messages
- Proper transaction management

### 5. **Maintainability**
- Clear code organization
- Single responsibility principle
- Easier to modify business logic

## File Structure

```
src/
├── services/
│   ├── index.js              # Service exports
│   ├── baseService.js        # Common functionality
│   ├── validationService.js  # Input validation
│   ├── authService.js        # Authentication logic
│   └── familyService.js      # Family tree logic
├── controllers/
│   ├── authController.js     # HTTP handling only
│   └── familyController.js   # HTTP handling only
└── models/                   # Data access layer
```

## Usage Examples

### Service Usage in Controllers
```javascript
// Import services
const { authService, familyService } = require('../services');

// Use in controller
const register = catchAsync(async (req, res) => {
  const result = await authService.register(req.body);
  res.status(201).json({ success: true, data: result });
});
```

### Direct Service Usage (for testing or other contexts)
```javascript
const { authService } = require('./src/services');

// Can be used directly without HTTP context
const user = await authService.register({
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  password: 'SecurePass123!',
  dateOfBirth: '1990-01-01',
  gender: 'male'
});
```

## Testing

A test script (`test-services.js`) was created to verify the implementation:
- Validates service structure
- Tests validation functionality
- Confirms proper service exports
- Verifies method availability

Run tests with: `node test-services.js`

## Migration Impact

### What Changed
- Controllers simplified from 400+ lines to ~80 lines
- Business logic moved to dedicated services
- Input validation centralized
- Error handling standardized

### What Stayed the Same
- API endpoints and responses unchanged
- Database models unchanged
- Authentication middleware unchanged
- Route definitions unchanged

## Future Enhancements

The service layer architecture enables easy addition of:
- Caching services
- Email notification services
- File upload services
- Third-party API integration services
- Background job services

## Conclusion

The service layer implementation successfully addresses the original issue of controllers directly accessing models. The architecture now follows best practices with clear separation of concerns, improved testability, and better maintainability.
