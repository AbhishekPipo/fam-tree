## 🏗️ Architecture Implementation

### 1. Database Schema ✅

**Users Table**: Complete user profiles with medical information
- Standard fields: firstName, middleName, lastName, email, password
- Profile: dateOfBirth, gender, location, profilePicture  
- Medical: hasMedication, medicationName, medicationFrequency, medicationTime
- Status: isOnline, isDeceased, staysWithUser
- **Parent References**: fatherId, motherId (key for family tree logic)

**DirectRelationship Table**: Spouses and partners only
- userId, relatedUserId (bidirectional storage)
- relationshipType: husband/wife/partner

**IndirectRelationship Table**: All other family relationships
- userId, relatedUserId (bidirectional storage)  
- **relationshipLevel**: +ve ancestors, -ve descendants, 0 same generation
- relationshipType: Dynamic labels based on perspective

### 2. Family Tree Logic ✅

**Relationship Levels**:
- Positive: Ancestors (1=parent, 2=grandparent, 3=great-grandparent)
- Negative: Descendants (-1=child, -2=grandchild, -3=great-grandchild)  
- Zero: Same generation (siblings, cousins)

**API Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "currentUser": { /* User details */ },
  "ancestors": [/* Sorted by level DESC */],
  "descendants": [/* Sorted by level ASC with parentInfo */], 
  "adjacent": [/* Spouses and siblings */],
  "totalMembers": 7
}
```

**Parent Chain Tracking**: Uses fatherId/motherId to show direct parent connections for grandchildren and beyond.

### 3. Sample Data Implementation ✅

**Complete Family Structure**:
```
Ramesh (grandfather) ↔ Mallika (grandmother)
       ↓
Prashanth (father) ↔ Anjali (mother)  
       ↓                    ↓
   Simran (daughter)    Arjun (son)
       ↓                    ↓
   Elina (granddaughter) Rohan (grandson)
```

All relationships are bidirectionally stored with proper levels and dynamic labels.

### 4. Authentication System ✅

- JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- User registration, login, logout, profile management
- Token-based session management with expiration
- Protected routes with middleware authentication

### 5. API Endpoints ✅

**Authentication**:
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login  
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Update profile

**Family Tree**:
- `GET /api/family/tree` - Get complete family tree
- `GET /api/family/members` - Get all family members
- `POST /api/family/member` - Add new family member
- `DELETE /api/family/member/:id` - Remove family member

### 6. Advanced Features ✅

- **Dynamic Relationship Labels**: Change based on logged user's perspective
- **Bidirectional Relationships**: All relationships stored from both perspectives  
- **Level-based Organization**: Clear generational hierarchy
- **Parent Connection Info**: Shows direct parent-child chains
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Input sanitization and error handling
- **Interactive Testing**: Web interface for easy API testing

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Complete automated setup
./auto-setup.sh

# Or manual setup
npm install
npm run setup-db  
npm run dev

# Test the API
npm run test-api
```

## 🔑 Sample Login Credentials

| User | Email | Password | Role |

| Anjali | anjali@family.com | FamilyTree123! | Mother |
| Simran | simran@family.com | FamilyTree123! | Daughter |
| Ramesh | ramesh@family.com | FamilyTree123! | Grandfather |

## 🧪 Testing Options

1. **Web Interface** (Recommended): http://localhost:3000
2. **Postman Collection**: Import `postman-collection.json`
3. **Automated Script**: `npm run test-api`
4. **Manual cURL**: Commands in README.md
